    "- Pack different kinds of variables into a single block(capsule).\n",
    "- We could have had functions that would return dictionaries with arguments passed in function.\n",
    "- But, those functions wouldn't have access to other variables in the dictionary.\n",
    "- Hence, class is a better alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Abstraction:- \n",
    "- Abstract means a kind of a summary of a large write-up.\n",
    "- Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.\n",
    "- Abstract classes and Interfaces are a way to achieve abstraction. They can't be instantiated.\n",
    "- So basically, we can simply extend abstract classes, so kind of its a blueprint for other classes.\n",
    "- The extended classes will be simple to understand as they themselves don't contain the abstract class' data.\n",
    "- Thus, it gets simple to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) Inheritance:- \n",
    "- Classes can inherit other classes.\n",
    "- And because abstract classes need to be inherited, inheritance is necessary for abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.) Polymorphism:- \n",
    "- Poly-> Many, morph-> form/change form\n",
    "- Any capsule can exist in multiple forms.\n",
    "- Also, a function previously defined can be overloaded by introducing more parameters, or be overrided by changing its definition.\n",
    "- Thus, that same function is now existing in multiple forms."
